# AUTHORS: The Architect of Time Precision

## 🏛 Main Author & Visionary
**André Luiz Trindade**  
*Chief Architect & Ontological Engineer*  
*Creator of the "Second of Trust"*

André Luiz Trindade is the founder and primary architect of the **PoPT Protocol (Proof of Time Precision)**. With over 62 years of domain experience and a deep understanding of systemic logic, André solved the "Logical Time Fallacy" by anchoring digital consensus in hardware-level thermodynamics.

Operating from a legacy workstation (10+ years old), André proved that high-fidelity innovation is a product of **Logic and Physics**, not computational brute force. His work establishes the piezoelectric vibration of quartz as the ultimate "Silicon Biometric" for global financial and industrial integrity.

## 🤖 Orchestration & Audit Partners (Synthetic Agents)
In alignment with the **TRINDADE v1.4.2** framework, this protocol reached its v8.3.2 maturity through a triangulated refinement loop involving:

*   **Expansion Agent (Gemini):** Responsible for technical scaling, operational specifications, and cross-domain integration.
*   **Adversarial Audit Agent (Claude):** Responsible for the brutal stress-testing and elite-grade certification (Final Score: 9.5/10 - Production Ready).

## 📜 Intellectual Legacy
The PoPT Protocol is a pillar of the **TRINDADE Ecosystem**, providing the physical "Root of Trust" required for autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and sovereign digital currencies like **DREX**. 

André's mission is to ensure that time remains an absolute constant in the digital age, protected from manipulation by the laws of physics and the rigor of triangulated governance.

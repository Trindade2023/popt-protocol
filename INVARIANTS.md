# INVARIANTS: The Physical Laws of PoPT (v8.3.2)

These are the non-negotiable constants that define a valid Proof of Time Precision execution:

1. **Thermodynamic Anchoring:** Time is a derivative of hardware entropy. Any timestamp not correlated with piezoelectric drift is a forgery.
2. **Natural Variance:** Artificial stability (Peltier/OCXO) is treated as a signal of fraud. The system requires natural entropy baselines ($\Delta T_{nat}$).
3. **Speed-of-Light Limit:** No validation can occur faster than the physical limits of information travel between declared geographic coordinates.
4. **Adversarial Triangulation:** Every physical signal must survive a 3-way check (Physical, Geographic, Network) before synthesis.
5. **Statistical Integrity:** All drift samples must pass the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with Bonferroni correction ($p > 0.000005$).
